# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Names

- **`boostmebitch`** — repo, working directory, npm package name, and `APP_NAME` default for the Podcast Index `User-Agent`.
- **"Boost Me Bitch"** — display name in the page header and `<title>`.
- **`BoostMeBitch`** — `app_name` in the boostagram TLV JSON and `client` tag on published Nostr notes (CamelCase, no spaces — matches Helipad-aggregator convention used by Fountain, StableKraft, etc.).

The README at the repo root describes the architecture in detail; treat it as the spec.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local       # then fill in PI key + secret + Breez key
npm run dev                       # next dev
npm run build                     # next build
npm run start                     # next start (prod)
npm run lint                      # next lint — only checker in the repo
```

There is **no test runner, no typecheck script, and no formatter configured.** `next build` is the de facto typecheck (strict mode is on in `tsconfig.json`).

Path alias: `@/*` maps to the repo root (`tsconfig.json` `baseUrl: "."`). Imports look like `@/lib/types`, `@/components/player`.

`.env.local` keys: `PODCAST_INDEX_KEY` / `PODCAST_INDEX_SECRET` (server-only, used by `lib/pi.ts`) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BREEZ_API_KEY` (browser-readable; the Spark SDK initializes in the client because it's a self-custodial wallet — the key gates SDK usage, not user funds). `APP_NAME` is optional, defaults to `boostmebitch`.

## Server vs client boundary (don't cross it)

The Podcast Index credentials (`PODCAST_INDEX_KEY` / `PODCAST_INDEX_SECRET`) must never reach the browser. Enforced by file conventions, not bundler config:

- **Server-only:** `lib/pi.ts` (uses `node:crypto`, reads `process.env`, hits Podcast Index). Imported only by route handlers under `app/api/*`. Never import it from `components/` or from `app/page.tsx`. The BoostBox proxy at `app/api/lightning/boostbox/route.ts` follows the same pattern — it reads `BOOSTBOX_URL` / `BOOSTBOX_API_KEY` and forwards to the upstream service so the API key never reaches the browser.
- **Browser-only:** `lib/store.ts` (Zustand, `'use client'`), `lib/v4v/nwc.ts` / `webln.ts` / `lnaddr.ts` / `spark.ts` / `boostbox.ts`, `lib/nostr/`, `lib/storage.ts`, `lib/podcast-meta.ts` — they all touch `window.*`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, IndexedDB (Breez SDK), or load WASM. SSR guards exist (`typeof window === 'undefined'`) but assume client context.
- **Isomorphic:** `lib/types.ts` (pure types), `lib/v4v/boost.ts` (orchestration logic; pulled in by client code).

Components fetch via the local API routes (`fetch('/api/feed?id=…')`) — they never call Podcast Index directly.

## Nostr identity enrichment

`loginWithExtension()` only returns `{ pubkey, npub }` from NIP-07. After login (or after the fast-path identity hydration described below), `components/nostr-auth.tsx:loadProfile` runs in the background and merges five more pieces onto/around the identity:

- **Profile metadata (kind:0):** `name`, `display_name`, `picture`, `nip05`, `about` — used to render the avatar + display name in the header. Also auto-fills the boost modal's "From" field.
- **NIP-65 relay list (kind:10002):** `writeRelays` is the union of unmarked entries and entries marked `write`. Used as the publish target for boost notes and favorites events when present.
- **NIP-51 favorites (kind:30003 with `d:boostmebitch:favorites`):** the user's saved-podcast set. See "Favorites" below.
- **NIP-51 mute list (kind:10000):** the user's muted accounts. Both public p-tags and (best-effort) NIP-04-encrypted private p-tags inside `event.content` are read so this app interoperates with Damus/Amethyst. See "Mutes" below.
- **Spark wallet backup (kind:30078 with `d:boostmebitch:wallet:spark`):** NIP-44 v2 encrypted-to-self mnemonic. Best-effort silent restore: if found, `sparkInitFromMnemonic` runs in the background and the account-menu's Spark section flips to "wallet ready" without user action. Failures (no NIP-44 in signer, no backup yet, decrypt error) are swallowed — user can hit "Create new" or "Restore from Nostr" manually.

All queries run against `DEFAULT_RELAYS`. If a user has none of those events on those relays, we fall back to the npub-only header, default publish set, empty favorites, empty mute list, and empty wallet respectively. NIP-07 permissions ever requested: `getPublicKey` (login), `signEvent` (each boost / favorites / mute / wallet mutation), `nip04.encrypt`/`nip04.decrypt` (private mute list only), and `nip44.encrypt`/`nip44.decrypt` (wallet backup only). We do NOT fetch contacts (kind:3), DMs, reactions, or anything else.

**Fast-path identity hydration:** on page load, `nostr-auth.tsx` decodes the cached `bmb:npub` synchronously via `nip19.decode` and sets a bare `{ pubkey, npub }` identity *immediately*. It also reads `storage.profile.get(pubkey)`, `storage.favorites.get(npub)`, and `storage.muted.get(npub)` and applies them to the store within the same frame — so the header avatar+name, favorites panel, and mute filter are all populated from cache before any relay round-trip. The signer (`window.nostr.getPublicKey`) is only called lazily, when the user actually needs to sign something. `loadProfile` then refreshes profile / relay-list / favorites / mutes / Spark backup *in parallel* (one `Promise.all`), bounded by the relay query timeout described below.

**Relay query timeouts.** Every `pool.querySync` site passes a `maxWait` from `lib/nostr/pool.ts`: `QUERY_MAX_WAIT_MS = 4000` for single-author lookups (kind:0, kind:10000, kind:10002, kind:30003, kind:30078, kind:6) and `FEED_QUERY_MAX_WAIT_MS = 8000` for broad feed scans (kind:1 with `#i`/`#k` filters, the reply-tree BFS, profile/quoted-event bulk fetches). Without these, a relay that never sends EOSE would keep the WebSocket open and pin the browser tab in the loading state. The 4s/8s split is a tradeoff: short enough to bound the favicon spinner, long enough that broad scans return complete results.

`resolvePublishRelays(identity)` in `lib/nostr/` is the single source of truth for "which relays do we publish to": localStorage `bmb:relays` override → identity NIP-65 write relays → `DEFAULT_RELAYS`. Capped at 20 to keep publish latency bounded.

## Signers (NIP-07 extension + Amber NIP-55)

The whole codebase reads from `window.nostr` (publish.ts, mutes.ts, wallet-backup.ts, zap.ts, boost.ts). Two signer paths feed that surface:

- **NIP-07 extension** (Alby, nos2x, etc., desktop). Already at `window.nostr` when present; we just call it.
- **Amber on Android** (NIP-55, see `lib/nostr/amber.ts`). A native app, not an extension. We polyfill `window.nostr` with an `AmberSigner` instance that dispatches each request to the Amber app via the `nostrsigner:` URL scheme and reads the result back from the system clipboard. Round-trip looks like: `nostrsigner:<urlEncoded payload>?compressionType=none&returnType=event&type=<get_public_key|sign_event|nip04_encrypt|...>` (no callbackUrl per spec — Amber returns via clipboard) → user approves in Amber → user returns → first user gesture (pointerdown/touchstart/keydown anywhere on the page) reads the clipboard with fresh transient activation. `lib/nostr/signer.ts:activateAmberSigner()` installs the polyfill and `deactivateAmberSigner()` restores the original. `restoreAmberSigner(pubkey)` is the synchronous fast-path on page load — `nostr-auth.tsx`'s useEffect calls it when `storage.signer.get() === 'amber'`.

The button label declares the signer the click will use: "Sign in with Nostr" when `window.nostr` is present, "Sign in with Amber" otherwise on Android, neither on desktop without an extension. While an Amber sign-in is in flight, `<AmberCompletion>` always renders a "◆ Continue from Amber" recovery button + "Paste manually" textarea — these are shown unconditionally because `visibilitychange` is unreliable on standalone-PWA returns and we can't gate the recovery UI on lifecycle detection.

**Capability helpers** in `lib/nostr/signer.ts`: `getNip04()` / `getNip44()` (return the API or null) and `requireNip44()` (throws a user-facing error). Use these instead of inlining `typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.nostr?.nipXX` — the wallet backup uses `requireNip44`, mutes use `getNip04` with policies that vary by call site (warn-and-degrade-to-public on encrypt; warn-and-preserve-as-opaque-blob on decrypt).

## PWA install

`public/manifest.json` + `public/sw.js` + `<SwRegister>` (`components/sw-register.tsx`, mounted in `app/layout.tsx`) make the app installable. Display mode is `standalone`; manifest icons live at `public/icons/icon-{192,512}.png` + `public/icon.svg` (mask-friendly). iPhone splash screens are in `public/splash/` and referenced via `<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image">` in the layout. Header padding includes `pt-[env(safe-area-inset-top)]` so the bolt + title clear the iPhone notch / dynamic island in standalone mode.

The service worker has **no precaching** — Next.js emits hashed bundle URLs that change every build, so any stale cache would silently break the app for installed users. Every request goes straight to the network, exactly as it would without a SW. The empty `fetch` handler exists only so Chrome / Edge surface the install prompt.

## Favorites (NIP-51 kind:30003)

Logged-in users can ♡ a podcast row to favorite it. Storage is split:

- **Authoritative:** a NIP-51 kind:30003 event, `d`-tag `boostmebitch:favorites`, with one `i: podcast:guid:<guid>` + `k: podcast:guid` per favorite. Published to the user's NIP-65 write relays.
- **Cache:** localStorage `bmb:favorites:<npub>` (or `bmb:favorites:guest` when not signed in) holds the full `FavoritePodcast[]` so the left "Favorites" panel renders instantly without re-resolving GUIDs.

Toggle UX: each click is optimistic and updates Zustand + localStorage immediately. Publishing to Nostr is **debounced 1.5 s** via `schedulePublishFavorites` so rapid hearting collapses into a single signing prompt.

Hydration on login (in `loadProfile`):
1. Fetch the user's kind:30003 event.
2. Compare `event.created_at` (s) vs the newest `addedAt` (ms) in the local cache.
3. If Nostr is newer or local is empty, adopt the Nostr guid set; resolve unknown guids via `/api/by-guid` (which proxies Podcast Index `/podcasts/byguid`). Cached entries that lack `artwork` are also re-resolved so older caches written before that field existed get auto-backfilled.
4. If local is newer, push it back up to Nostr (debounced).

The hydrator preserves each entry's original `addedAt` when refreshing it via `/api/by-guid` — backfilling artwork doesn't reshuffle the favorites list. The favorites panel itself sorts alphabetically by `title` via `localeCompare({ sensitivity: 'base' })`.

`FavoritePodcast` carries both `image` and `artwork`. `<PodcastCover>` (see "Podcast artwork" below) tries them in order and falls back to a colored-initial tile, so a dead `image` URL doesn't leave a phantom border in the favorites row.

Sign-out clears the in-memory favorites; the per-npub localStorage cache is left in place so re-signing in is fast.

**UUID filter at parse:** `lib/nostr/favorites.ts` enforces a UUID shape on every `i: podcast:guid:<value>` tag in the relay event. Older versions of this app (and some other clients reusing the d-tag) wrote feed IDs and arbitrary strings into the i-tag. Those are returned as `droppedGuids` and never sent to PI. When the count is non-zero, `nostr-auth.tsx` registers `window.bmbCleanFavorites()` so the user can republish a cleaned event from devtools.

What this code deliberately doesn't do: episode-level favorites, multiple lists/categories, or any "share this list" UI. The kind:30003 is publicly readable to anyone with the user's pubkey + relay set.

## Mutes (NIP-51 kind:10000)

Logged-in users can hide an author's notes from the global / per-podcast feeds via the 🚫 button on each `<NoteCard>`. The mute list lives at NIP-51 kind:10000 so it interoperates with Damus / Amethyst / Coracle.

The kind:10000 event holds two parallel lists in `lib/nostr/mutes.ts:MuteListState`:

- **Public** `p`-tags in the event's plaintext tag array.
- **Private** `p`-tags inside an NIP-04-encrypted-to-self JSON tag-array in `event.content`. Damus defaults to private; we follow that lead — `mutePubkey()` writes new mutes to the private list, and `unmutePubkey()` removes from both lists.

When the signer doesn't expose `nip04`, the read path parks the raw ciphertext in `unreadablePrivateContent` and the publish path passes that blob through verbatim — so we never destroy private mutes set in another client. New mutes degrade to public p-tags in that case.

Non-`p` tags (e.g. `e` muted threads, `t` hashtags, `word` keywords) on the relay event are also preserved verbatim through the round-trip, even though we never render them.

Filtering is at render time: `<NoteCard>` early-returns null for muted authors, the feed components filter top-level notes by `mutedPubkeys`, and reply rendering filters before mapping so an all-muted reply tree leaves no empty divider div. Unmute → instant uncovering on next paint, no refetch needed.

Storage: `bmb:muted:<npub>` (or `bmb:muted:guest`) holds the full `MuteListState` JSON. `storage.muted.get/set` traffics in `MuteListState` directly — the legacy `{ pubkeys, otherTags, updatedAt }` shape from earlier versions is auto-promoted to public-only on read by a private `coerceToMuteState` helper inside `lib/storage.ts`. Hydration mirrors the favorites pattern (last-write-wins on `event.created_at`).

The account-menu surfaces a "Muted accounts (N)" collapsible disclosure when the set is non-empty (collapsed by default — tap to expand). Per-pubkey kind:0 lookups only fire while the section is expanded so a long mute list doesn't pay the resolve cost on every menu open.

## Podcast artwork (`components/podcast-cover.tsx`)

`<PodcastCover image artwork title seed className />` is the canonical podcast artwork slot. It tries `image` first, falls back to `artwork` on `onError`, and finally renders a deterministic colored-initial tile (hue derived from `seed ?? title`). Used by the show-detail header, the search/favorites row, and each episode-list row.

The two-URL fallback exists because PI returns RSS `<image><url>` as `image` and `<itunes:image>` as `artwork` — the two often disagree. Homegrown Hits in particular has a dead `bowlafterbowl.com` `<image>` but a working `<itunes:image>`. Always pass both fields when you have them; the renderer handles the rest.

The `Podcast` and `FavoritePodcast` types carry both `image` and `artwork`; episodes also expose `image` and `feedImage` (the channel artwork PI returns alongside each item) so the per-episode cover can fall back to the show art when the item lacks its own.

## Wallets — account menu (top right)

All wallet config lives in the avatar dropdown rendered by `components/nostr-auth.tsx:AccountMenu`. The boost modal's rail picker (`components/boost-modal/rail-picker.tsx`) is a pure tab selector — no setup affordances. The hint line at the bottom of the picker points users back to the menu when no rail is configured.

Three wallet sub-cards, each its own component:

- `components/nwc-wallet.tsx` — paste a `nostr+walletconnect://` URI / disconnect. Persists to `bmb:nwc_uri` via `lib/v4v/nwc.ts`.
- `components/spark-wallet.tsx` — Create new (BIP-39 → mnemonic display → NIP-44 encrypt-to-self → kind:30078 publish → SDK init), Restore from Nostr (fetch + decrypt + init), Disconnect. Once initialized, `<ReadyPanel>` shows the live balance + a deposit-invoice generator (BOLT11 + QR + copy + auto-dismiss when the payment lands).
- `components/webln-wallet.tsx` — auto-detects `window.webln`. "Enable for this site" pre-authorizes so the first boost doesn't pause for a permission prompt.

Wallet state changes (Spark init / disconnect / auto-restore landing) propagate to the UI via the `subscribeSpark()` listener pattern in `lib/v4v/spark.ts`. The menu re-reads `hasSpark()` on every notification — works whether the menu is closed or already open when state flips.

## Spark rail (Breez SDK)

`lib/v4v/spark.ts` wraps `@breeztech/breez-sdk-spark`. The package ships as a WASM module with multiple entry points; we use the default browser export and the SDK's default export (`initBreezSDK`) as a one-shot WASM loader. Init is two-stage and the WASM only lands in the bundle the first time a user opens a Spark wallet (dynamic import inside `sparkInitFromMnemonic`).

Load-bearing rules:

1. **BOLT11 only.** Spark cannot keysend. `lib/v4v/boost.ts` rejects every `node`-type recipient on the Spark rail per-leg with a clear error, never silently. lnaddress recipients work because `payOne` fetches a BOLT11 from the LNURL-pay callback first.
2. **Network is `mainnet` or `regtest` — there is no public testnet for Spark.** First end-to-end boost moves real sats. Use `network: 'regtest'` against a local node for development; the type union enforces this.
3. **`storageDir` is keyed on `(ownerPubkey[:8], sha256(mnemonic)[:8])`.** Two wallets for the same npub get different SDK directories — `walletStorageDir()` does the hashing. Keying on pubkey alone collides if a user disconnects + creates fresh; the SDK either rejects re-init or corrupts existing wallet state.
4. **Two-step send.** `sparkPayInvoice(invoice)` runs `sdk.prepareSendPayment({ paymentRequest })` then `sdk.sendPayment({ prepareResponse })`. Preimage extracted from `payment.preimage` or `payment.details.htlcDetails.preimage` depending on the payment shape.
5. **Events drive the balance, not polling.** `sparkInitFromMnemonic` exposes `subscribeSparkEvents()` wrapping the SDK's `addEventListener`. `paymentSucceeded`, `claimedDeposits`, `newDeposits`, `synced` trigger an immediate `sparkGetInfo()` refresh in `<ReadyPanel>`. `paymentSucceeded`/`claimedDeposits`/`newDeposits` also auto-dismiss any outstanding deposit invoice.

The mnemonic is published encrypt-to-self as kind:30078 with `d:boostmebitch:wallet:spark` — see `lib/nostr/wallet-backup.ts`. Anyone with the user's nsec can decrypt; the Nostr backup is convenience, not the only copy. The seed-display step in `<SparkWallet>` is the user's chance to write it down. Re-create flow checks for an existing backup and confirms before overwriting (kind:30078 is a NIP-33 replaceable event — newer wins, prior backup is gone forever from relays).

**Restore-side relay union.** `fetchEncryptedMnemonic` queries the union of `resolvePublishRelays(identity)` + `DEFAULT_RELAYS` (deduped, capped at 20) with the longer 8s `FEED_QUERY_MAX_WAIT_MS`. Otherwise a fresh Android sign-in via Amber, where NIP-65 (kind:10002) hasn't hydrated yet when the user taps Restore, falls back to `DEFAULT_RELAYS` and misses a backup that lives on the user's outbox relays. `publishEncryptedMnemonic` stays on `resolvePublishRelays(identity)` — backups only go to intended write relays.

**Post-restore balance race.** `<ReadyPanel>` attaches the SDK event listener BEFORE the first `getInfo()` call so any `synced` event from this point on is caught, then re-polls at 2s/5s/12s after mount. Otherwise Breez Spark's initial sync after `connect()` can complete between our `connect` resolving and the listener attaching, leaving the panel showing a cached 0 balance forever (the user's previous workaround was disconnect+reconnect).

## Show-level boost

`BoostModal` now accepts `episode` as optional. When omitted (`isShowBoost = !episode`), the modal:

- Headlines the podcast title and skips the playback-timestamp line.
- Reads the value block from `podcast.value` instead of `episode.value`.
- Builds a boostagram with `podcast`, `feedID`, `url`, `remote_feed_guid`, but skips `episode`, `itemID`, `episode_guid`, `remote_item_guid`. `ts: 0`.
- The Nostr boost note's auto-formatted body skips the `📻 <episode>` line and the `podcast:item:guid:` `i`-tag.

The "⚡ BOOST" button at the top-right of `EpisodeList`'s header opens the modal in this mode (gated on `podcast.value.recipients.length > 0`). The per-episode boost path in `Player` is unchanged.

## Boost flow invariants

`components/boost-modal/index.tsx` orchestrates the user flow (state + `go()`), with render-only slice components in the same folder; `lib/v4v/boost.ts` is the engine. A few rules are load-bearing:

1. **Lightning first, then Nostr.** `publishBoostNote` only fires after `sendBoost` returns *and* at least one recipient succeeded (`collected.some(r => r.ok)`). This prevents false "I boosted" notes when payments all fail. Don't reorder.
2. **Rail priority is NWC > Spark > WebLN.** `pickRail()` in `lib/v4v/boost.ts` returns `'nwc'` if a URI is saved, else `'spark'` if a Spark wallet is initialized, else `'webln'` if a browser provider is detected, else `null`. The modal lets the user override but defaults to this. Spark only handles BOLT11 / lnaddress legs — see "Spark rail" above.
3. **Episode value-block fallback happens server-side.** `app/api/feed/route.ts` does `e.value ?? podcast.value` before returning. Components assume `episode.value` is populated when the channel has one — don't re-implement the fallback in the modal.
4. **Splits use weights, not percentages.** `splitSats()` floors per-recipient, then dumps the remainder onto the first non-fee recipient. `ValueRecipient.split` is a weight; total weight is the denominator.
5. **TLV records:** boostagram JSON goes in record `7629169` (Podcasting 2.0 standard) — that's the only TLV we add for boost metadata. The `sender_id` field already lives inside the JSON; we deliberately do **not** also emit a separate `696969` sender record because that key collides with shared-node sub-account routing (e.g. getalby.com uses `customKey=696969 customValue=<sub-account>`). Per-recipient `customKey`/`customValue` from the value block IS attached to the keysend so payments to shared nodes route to the right sub-account. Keep the JSON shape compatible with Helipad / Fountain / Castamatic ingestion.
6. **WebLN customRecords are plain JSON, not hex.** WebLN providers (Alby, Mutiny) hex-encode `customRecords` values internally before putting them on the wire. Pre-hexing here causes double-encoding and Helipad can't `JSON.parse` the boostagram. NWC's `pay_keysend` is the opposite — NIP-47 spec requires hex-encoded TLV values. See `tlvHexFor` (NWC) vs `recordsForKeysend` (WebLN) in `lib/v4v/boost.ts` — they look symmetric but the wire formats are genuinely different.
7. **Note amount is intent, not actual.** `formatContent` and the `amount` tag use `boostagram.value_msat_total` (what the user clicked Send on), not the sum of successful legs. A user who boosts 100 sats and has one leg fail still posts "Boosted 100 sats" — the partial breakdown is visible in the modal and Helipad.
8. **BoostBox is LNURL-only.** `lib/v4v/boostbox.ts` POSTs the metadata via the `/api/lightning/boostbox` proxy *before* `fetchLnInvoice`, then puts the returned `desc` (`rss::payment::boost <url>`) in the LUD-21 `comment` field. Keysend recipients are untouched — TLV `7629169` already carries the boostagram inline. Failure of the BoostBox call is non-fatal; the LNURL leg falls back to `boostagram.message` as the comment so the payment still goes through.

## Nostr publish shape

`publishBoostNote()` in `lib/nostr/boost-notes.ts` builds a kind:1 with:

- NIP-73 `i`/`k` tag pairs for `podcast:guid:<feed-guid>` and (when an episode is in scope) `podcast:item:guid:<item-guid>`.
- `r` tag pointing at the **best public landing page** via `podcastLandingUrl`: prefers `https://pod.link/<itunesId>` (smart deep-link that auto-routes to the user's podcast app), falls back to `https://podcastindex.org/podcast/<feedId>`, then the raw RSS feed URL.
- `amount` tag in millisats — uses `boostagram.value_msat_total` (intent), not the sum of successful legs.
- `client` tag — `boostagram.app_name`, defaults to `BoostMeBitch`.
- `t` tags `boostagram` + `value4value`.

Publish target is `resolvePublishRelays(identity)`: localStorage `bmb:relays` override → identity NIP-65 write relays → `DEFAULT_RELAYS`. Kept to a max of 20 relays.

The auto-formatted note body lives in `formatContent()` in the same file (override per call with `contentOverride`):

```
⚡ Boost ⚡

[boostagram message, if present]

Boosted N sats → [podcast title]
📻 [episode title, omitted on show-level boosts]

[pod.link or PI URL]
```

Same `signAndPublish` helper handles both kind:1 boost notes and kind:30003 favorites, so a third event kind would be ~10 lines.

## v4v-toolkit swap-out boundary

`lib/v4v/*` and `lib/nostr/` are intentionally the only files that talk to wallets / signers. Components import only from these entry points: `lib/v4v/boost.ts` (orchestrator), `lib/v4v/nwc.ts` (URI persistence), `lib/v4v/spark.ts` (Spark wallet surface), `lib/nostr/` barrel (auth + publish + wallet backup). When swapping in `v4v-toolkit`, replace internals here without touching `components/` or `app/`.

## Feed loading (`useNostrFeed`)

`lib/nostr/use-feed.ts` is the stale-while-revalidate hook behind the global and per-podcast feeds. Three rules are load-bearing:

1. **Cache always paints first.** `storage.feedNotes.get(cacheKey)` returns whatever's in localStorage regardless of age (no TTL gate). The hook sets that into state synchronously inside the mount effect so a hard refresh paints the last-seen feed within one frame.
2. **Refresh is incremental.** `refresh()` reads the newest `created_at` from the current `notes` and asks the relay for events with `since: newest + 1`. Novel events (deduped by id) are prepended onto the existing list; the merged result is written back to cache. The first load (or any load with empty notes) falls back to a full fetch with no `since`. This is much faster than re-downloading the whole feed and tolerates the wider 8s `FEED_QUERY_MAX_WAIT_MS` without making the user wait.
3. **No auto-refresh.** Refresh fires on mount and when the user clicks the refresh button — never on a timer. Components that need to "wake" the feed after a local mutation (e.g. `boostsTick` after a sent boost) do so by reading directly from their own source of truth and intermixing it client-side, not by re-fetching from relays.

Trade-off worth knowing: incremental refresh only catches new top-level boosts. New replies under an existing note, or new zaps stacked onto an existing boost, won't surface until that root event is re-fetched. There's no force-full-reload affordance today; if needed, the hook would need to expose a separate action.

## /api/by-guid resilience and PI breaker

`/api/by-guid` 5xxs when the Podcast Index keys are missing or PI is down. Without protection, a returning user with a 100-guid favorites set hammers the broken endpoint on every reload — and StrictMode + Fast Refresh can amplify that into thousands of dev requests.

`lib/podcast-meta.ts` is the single resolver everyone uses (favorites hydrator, global Nostr feed, future surfaces). Four guards stacked:

1. In-memory `Map<guid, Podcast | null>` — fastest path within a page session, also caches misses so the same guid is only attempted once per load.
2. `storage.podcastMeta` (localStorage, 7-day TTL) — survives reloads.
3. **Circuit breaker.** First 5xx response trips `sessionStorage['bmb:pi:dead'] = '1'`. Persists across reloads in the same tab (a hard refresh starts a new session). `piMaybeUp()` lets callers gate parallel batches before firing fetches.
4. Network.

Callers that fan out (favorites hydrator, global Nostr feed) use a **probe-first-then-batch** pattern: await one `resolvePodcastByGuid` first, check `piMaybeUp()`, only then fire `Promise.all` over the rest. One wasted fetch per page load instead of N.

The global feed's resolver runs in a `useEffect` that depends only on `notes` (not on the local `podcasts` state). Tracking which guids have been attempted lives in a `useRef<Set<string>>` so `setPodcasts` doesn't re-fire the effect — that pattern caused a fetch storm where cancelled-but-already-in-flight requests kept pinning the dev server.

## Background art and the canvas-bg gotcha

`app/layout.tsx` renders the hero collage (`public/hero.jpg`) as a fixed full-viewport layer behind everything, with a 75% ink overlay and `<Image fill priority />` so it gets AVIF/WebP optimization. The `<html>` element carries `bg-ink` (NOT `<body>`); this matters because a `body` background propagates to the canvas and would paint over the fixed image layer regardless of z-index. If someone moves `bg-ink` back onto `<body>` the art will silently disappear. Same `hero.jpg` doubles as the OG image via `metadata.openGraph.images`.

## State + persistence

Zustand store (`lib/store.ts`) holds: `identity`, `current` (episode + podcast), `isPlaying`, `positionSec`, `selectedPodcast` (lifted out of `app/page.tsx` so a podcast-name link inside a `<NoteCard>` can route into the detail view without prop-drilling), `favorites`, `mutedPubkeys`, and `boostsTick`. No persistence — state is in-memory only.

Everything else lives in `localStorage` on the device and is never sent server-side. **All `bmb:*` keys are accessed through typed helpers in `lib/storage.ts`** — don't call `localStorage.getItem`/`setItem` directly anywhere else.

- `bmb:signer` — `'amber'` when the active signer is Amber via the AmberSigner polyfill; absent otherwise (NIP-07 extension or signed out). Read on page load to decide whether `restoreAmberSigner` needs to reinstall the polyfill onto `window.nostr` before any signing operation runs (`storage.signer`).
- `bmb:nwc_uri` — NWC URI (`storage.nwcUri`); `lib/v4v/nwc.ts` re-exports save/load/clear/has wrappers.
- `bmb:relays` — JSON array, manual publish-relay override (`storage.relays`); when absent, `resolvePublishRelays` falls back to NIP-65 then `DEFAULT_RELAYS`.
- `bmb:sender_name` — last "From" name typed into the boost modal (`storage.senderName`).
- `bmb:share_nostr` — '0' or absent. When '0', the boost modal defaults to **not** publishing a Nostr note for new boosts (`storage.shareNostr`).
- `bmb:npub` — sentinel for silent re-login on page load (`storage.npub`).
- `bmb:favorites:<npub>` / `bmb:favorites:guest` — per-identity favorites cache (`storage.favorites.get(npub) / .set(npub, …)`).
- `bmb:muted:<npub>` / `bmb:muted:guest` — per-identity NIP-51 kind:10000 mute-list cache (`storage.muted`). Stores `{ publicPubkeys, publicOtherTags, privatePubkeys, privateOtherTags, unreadablePrivateContent?, updatedAt }`.
- `bmb:profile3:<pubkey>` — kind:0 metadata cache (`storage.profile`). 7-day TTL on hits, 15-minute TTL on misses (so PROFILE_RELAYS additions or temporary outages re-resolve naturally). Used both for note authors in the global feed and for the signed-in user's own header. The `3` suffix is a schema version — bump it when the cached shape changes.
- `bmb:pmeta:<guid>` — `/api/by-guid` resolution cache, 7-day TTL (`storage.podcastMeta`). Used by the favorites hydrator, global Nostr feed, and any future surface that needs a `Podcast` from a guid.
- `bmb:feed:<key>` — last `DiscoveredNote[]` per feed surface (`storage.feedNotes`). Stored as a bare JSON array, **no TTL** — every `useNostrFeed` mount paints the cache regardless of age, then runs an incremental `since`-bounded refresh that prepends new events. The legacy `{ t, v }` wrapper from earlier versions is still tolerated on read so existing caches survive a deploy. Keys: `'global'` for the global feed, `'podcast:<guid>'` per podcast.
- `bmb:boosts:<npub>` / `bmb:boosts:guest` — local log of sent boosts (`storage.boosts`), capped at 200 newest-first. Each entry holds the boostagram intent + per-leg results, with the BoostBox URL on each LNURL leg and the published Nostr `noteId` patched in once `publishBoostNote` resolves. The Zustand `boostsTick` (`bumpBoosts()`) wakes up subscribers — `GlobalNostrFeed` mixes these into the relay-discovered notes and dedupes any whose `noteId` matches a returned note.

`sessionStorage` (per-tab, not per-device):

- `bmb:pi:dead` — circuit-breaker sentinel set when `/api/by-guid` returns 5xx. Persists across reloads in the same tab, cleared on hard refresh into a new tab.

External persistence: the **Spark wallet's mnemonic** lives encrypted on Nostr relays as kind:30078 (publicly readable, private to the user's nsec). The Breez SDK's own wallet state (UTXOs, payment history, etc.) lives in IndexedDB managed by the SDK at `bmb-spark-<pubkey:8>-<sha256(mnemonic):8>`.

If you add another persisted field, add a typed accessor to `lib/storage.ts` and follow the `bmb:*` prefix.

## Styling tokens

Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.ts`) defines a small custom palette used everywhere — don't introduce new colors without adding them here:

- `ink` (`#0a0a08`, background), `bone` (`#fdfaf3`, foreground — bright warm cream for contrast against the dark hero), `bolt` (`#fae500`, Lightning yellow), `nostr` (`#ff2d92`, magenta), `muted` (`#8a857a`, secondary text), `line` (`#1f1d18`, subtle borders).
- Fonts: `font-display` (Bricolage Grotesque), `font-mono` (JetBrains Mono).
- Animation: `animate-bolt` is a 1.4s opacity pulse used on the hero.

Reusable element classes (`.card`, `.btn`, `.btn-bolt`, `.btn-ghost`, `.input`, `.stamp`, `.headline`, `.seek`) are defined in `app/globals.css`. Read that file before inventing new ones.

## Conventions worth keeping

- **Podcast artwork goes through `<PodcastCover>`** (`components/podcast-cover.tsx`). It uses `<img>` (not `next/image` — `next.config.mjs` allows all HTTPS hosts, but per-host configuration would still be needed for `next/image`'s optimizer), tries `image` then `artwork` on `onError`, and falls back to a deterministic colored-initial tile so a dead URL never leaves a phantom border. The hero/OG art at `public/hero.jpg` IS served via `next/image` because it's a known local asset and we want AVIF/WebP for LCP.
- **Auxiliary relay sets in `lib/nostr/discover.ts`** open extras (PROFILE_RELAYS, NIP-65 hints, quote-ref relay hints) on top of the base set. Wrap those in `withExtraRelays(pool, baseRelays, extraRelays, fn)` from `lib/nostr/pool.ts` — it deduplicates the union, runs your query inside the closure, and closes only the newly-opened extras in `finally` (swallowing close errors). Don't write the open / track-opened / try-finally / close pattern inline; four near-identical copies were collapsed into the helper.
- **Browse-mode layout** in `app/page.tsx` is single-column. Selecting a podcast (search result, favorite, or a podcast-name link inside a Nostr note card) sets `selectedPodcast` in the Zustand store, which flips to the detail view (full-width episode list + per-podcast Nostr feed). Don't re-introduce a right-pane "select a podcast on the left" empty state — it lied about behavior, the click flips the whole layout.
- Native HTML5 `<audio>` plays the enclosure URL directly — no proxy, no transcoding.
- API routes return `{ error }` JSON with appropriate status codes via `getErrorMessage(e, fallback)` from `lib/util.ts`; clients swallow errors silently. When adding new routes, match the shape so a future error UI can render uniformly.
- Inline SVG icons (`components/icons.tsx:BoltIcon`) on yellow buttons instead of `⚡` emoji — the colored emoji is invisible on `bg-bolt`. Use the icon component, not the emoji, for any new bolt-yellow button. Other places (yellow text on dark bg, V4V stamps) keep the emoji because the colored glyph reads fine.
